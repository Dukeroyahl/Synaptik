## Semver Plugin Fix Validation
Testing improved semver-action configuration with:

- Correct fallback tag: 1.0.3 (actual latest in main branch)
- Added noVersionBumpBehavior: current
- Removed problematic v1.1.0 tag that wasn't in main branch history
- Enhanced tag detection and error handling

This should trigger a patch version bump (1.0.4) due to the fix: prefix.
The semver-action will now properly compare against the correct baseline tag.

## New Test: Semver Workflow Validation
Testing the complete semver workflow with proper tag baseline:
- Current tag: 1.0.3 (created at commit 861e2be)
- Expected next version: 1.0.4 (patch bump for fix: commit)
- Workflow should create release/1.0.4 branch automatically
- This validates the entire automated versioning pipeline
