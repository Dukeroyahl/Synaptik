## Semver Plugin Fix Validation
Testing improved semver-action configuration with:

- Correct fallback tag: 1.0.3 (actual latest in main branch)
- Added noVersionBumpBehavior: current
- Removed problematic v1.1.0 tag that wasn't in main branch history
- Enhanced tag detection and error handling

This should trigger a patch version bump (1.0.4) due to the fix: prefix.
The semver-action will now properly compare against the correct baseline tag.
